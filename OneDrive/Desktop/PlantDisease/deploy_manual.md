## ✅ **Frontend Successfully Deployed to Vercel!**
**Production URL**: https://frontend-9gzl8951s-vineeth-kumars-projects-8518b7a2.vercel.app

## 🔧 **Backend Deployment to Railway (Manual Steps)**

Since the Railway CLI is having timeout issues, please follow these manual steps:

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. Open: https://railway.app
2. Login with your account (vineethkumar1233@gmail.com)
3. Click on your project: "plant disease detection"

### **Step 2: Deploy Backend**
1. **Click "New Service"** → **"GitHub Repo"**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository** (if not already connected)
3. **Select the `backend` folder** as the source
4. **Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy**

### **Step 3: Get Your Railway URL**
After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

### **Step 4: Update Frontend Environment**
Once you have your Railway URL, update the frontend environment:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com
2. **Select your project**: "frontend"
3. **Go to Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Add new variable**:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app`
5. **Redeploy frontend** (Vercel will auto-redeploy)

## 🌐 **Final Result**
- **Frontend**: https://frontend-9gzl8951s-vineeth-kumars-projects-8518b7a2.vercel.app
- **Backend**: Your Railway URL (to be deployed)
- **Full App**: Accessible worldwide via the frontend URL!

## 🚨 **If Railway Web Interface Fails**
Alternative deployment options:
1. **Heroku** (free tier available)
2. **Render** (free tier available)
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
4. **Google Cloud Run**

## 📞 **Need Help?**
The frontend is already live! Once you get the backend deployed, your app will be fully functional worldwide.
